# UHK Datasheets

This repository contains the datasheets of the ICs used in the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/), and its add-on modules, along with some related documentation.

## Base keyboard

The Kinetis K22P121M120SF7 ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller is used as the brain of the right keyboard half.

* [K22P121M120SF7 Reference Manual](K22P121M120SF7RM.pdf)

The Kinetis KL03P24M48SF0 ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller is used as the brain of the left keyboard half, and of the add-on modules.

* [KL03P24M48SF0 Reference Manual](KL03P24M48SF0RM.pdf)

The CAT24C256 I2C EEPROM is used in the right keyboard half to store the configuration of the UHK.

* [CAT24C256 256 kb I2C CMOS Serial EEPROM data sheet](CAT24C256-D.pdf)

The IS31FL3731 I2C LED driver is used in both keyboard halves to drive the LED display and per switch backlighting.

A custom LED segment display is used in the left keyboard half.

## Add-on modules

A BlackBerry trackball is used in the key cluster module. Even though this trackball doesn't seem to have any datasheets available, SparkFun sells a BlackBerry trackball breakout board, so we use their design as our reference design.

The ADNS-3530 optical sensor is used in the trackball module.

The IQS572 capacitive sensing controller is used in the touchpad module.

The part number of the trackpoint within our trackpoint module is unknown, and the label of the IC is scraped off, but it's probably the SK7102 FlexPointTM PS/2 Pointing Stick Mouse Encoder. We believe this because the trackpoint closely resembles the SK8702 FlexPointTM 3 Axis PS/2 Pointing Stick Module, which uses this IC.

* [The incomplete datasheet of the trackpoint](trackpoint/trackpoint_module.pdf) - Our supplier didn't provide us the name or complete datasheet of the trackpoint because he signed an NDA with the manufacturer.
* [SK8702 FlexPointTM 3 Axis PS/2 Pointing Stick Module](trackpoint/DS0013_SK8702_Datasheet.pdf) - No longer in production but this documentation may come in handy.
* [SK7102 FlexPointTM PS/2 Pointing Stick Mouse Encoder ](trackpoint/DS0006 SK7102 Datasheet.pdf) - The IC of the SK8702, and probably of the unknown trackpoint, too.
